// Succinct proofs for the liquidation identity, built off the request path.
//
// WHY OFF THE PATH. Plonk proving is 703 ms median, measured; Groth16 is 32 ms. The fast one is not
// available to us honestly — its circuit-specific ceremony had a single participant and it was our
// machine, so anyone holding that secret can forge. Plonk uses the public Hermez reference string.
// The 703 ms is not a parsing problem that a bigger machine fixes: reading the 5.3 MB key accounts
// for 187 ms of it and the remaining ~510 ms is FFT and MSM work in WASM. Moving that to Lambda makes
// it slower, not faster.
//
// So the caller does not wait for it. A caller who wants an on-chain proof is going to submit it in a
// transaction that takes seconds to confirm; 703 ms is invisible next to block time, and making the
// synchronous path pay for it would be optimising the wrong thing. The paid response returns at its
// usual speed carrying a retrieval URL, the proof is built in the background, and a free GET fetches
// it by content hash — which also lets a third party pull the proof for someone else's answer.
//
// AND IT LEAVES THIS THREAD. Deferring the work off the request path was not enough. Node runs one
// thread, so a proof being built for caller A blocked the event loop for up to 506 ms — measured —
// and caller B, who asked for no proof at all, paid for it. Production showed that as a p95 of one
// full second. The prover now lives in a worker (proverWorker.mjs) along with the snarkjs import and
// the 5.3 MB key, and this file keeps only integer encoding and a queue.
